It will help finding differenecs between two files easily

You will be able to easily go back to an earlier version if needed

The commits will have more logic than just automatic ones

Because Git is catered to Coding industry while the other ones are for
the general population

To see all the changes that have been done and to quickly see differences

Will give me more confidence as you can always revert back

Mainly big projects to keep track of everything
